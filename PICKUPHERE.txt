IDEAS:

	- socket.disconnect() to disconnect offenders trying to DDOS etc...
		- Count amount of requests.. if they reach a certain height in a certain amount of time, disconnect them, don't let them reconnect...

	- Skins = Props?
	
	- Buy, or Unlock?
	
	- Reads, "Strong read that tyler is a wolf"
				"Very strong read that tyler is a wolf"
				

	- eliminator decided 50/50 between total trusted and local trusted
	- funny image when hovering over players, if eating or eliminating...
	- other bonuses if trust reaches certain heights? punishments if suspect reaches certain heights?
	- sound fx during night when things are happening.. either a wolf is eating a sheep, getting blocked, getting blown up by trapper etc...
	- at start of each day, most trusted total gets a tip, the tips are about the most suspected people...
	- Lives = <3 symbol , pumpkin symbol (if halloween theme)
	
	Tip Ideas:
		- Player3 is not a regular sheep.

	Most trust, most "READS"!!!!! Most trusted player gets tip every round about highest suspected player(s)...
	- Can eliminator only target between top 2 suspects?
	
	Hypnotist, controls chat AND selections..
	
	- Instead of getting eaten, you get kidnapped... You work with other "kidnapped" players to try and save eachother to save Lives.
	
	- When you get kidnapped by wolves, you are playing a mini-game with other kidnapped wolves.  You communicate reads back to the team....?

RESET EVERYTHING:
	- db.users.drop()
	- db.playerStats.drop()
	- db.gamestate.drop()
	- db.gameHistory.drop()
	

APP WHERE PEOPLE CAN DONATE TO CAUSES?? Allow anyone to post a "Cause", people can look thru and donate?
Kickstarter but for everything.....
	- Fundraisers.com...
	- I was unlucky and should get money because of X / Y
	- Money needs to go here...

Since Node.js

- Express
	- Serve static content, used to connect with mongoDB probably, client request then server responds
	- JSON EDITOR Online

- Socket.io
	- client sends shit, server sends shit, they listen for eachother

- Redis
	- Memory caching service.  Store key / pair values or arrays in RAM for fast access
	- Store array_id (game_id + ent_id) : (user_id,username,type,x,y,d,m) of every player;
							("KEY")						("VALUE")
							(15-5675675) : (18,ian,wolf,0,0,0,0)

	- To use: (download / install mongoDB, install to folder C: name it "mongo")
		1. Open cmd, navigate to "C:/mongo/bin" and type "mongod"
		2. Open another cmd, navigate to "C:/mongo/bin" and type mongo, then to switch database type "use databasename"
		3. db.users.insert({username: "ian", password: "password", email: "ian@email.com"})
			3b. db.users.insert([{username: "tyler",password: "password", email: "tyler@email.com"},{username: "TeD", password: "password", email: "TeD@email.com"}])
		4. db.users.find(), or a nicer look: db.sheepwolf.find().pretty()
		5. Indexing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpkmFGuC9NQ
		6. Examples: http://howtonode.org/node-js-and-mongodb-getting-started-with-mongojs
		
		db.users.find() //SELECT * FROM users
		db.users.find({username:something}) //SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = something
		
		//delete an account
		db.users.remove({username: "ian"});
		
		db.users.update({username: "ian"})
		
		//add friend//
		db.users.update({username:"ian"},{$push: {friends: "FRIEND"}})
		
		//remove friend//
		db.users.update({username:"ian"},{$pull: {friends: "FRIEND"}})

OLD IDEAS

	- Math nerd mode (give lots of unreliable math so can solve game from math) 
	- Mini games
	- Poker like
	- Everyone stays alive, people propose "theories"
	- People have Hit Points, cannon (or other weapons) do damage.
	- Trivia / Skill testing questions
	- Change ratios around, 7wolves 2 sheep, 4v4, etc.
	- Players get speical objectives
	- Use your currency in the game
	- Items, bidding, silent auction, pick up dead players items
	- Team has shared money to spend... (special role "Banker", controls the money)
	- 3 cards, trade, they have abilities by themselves or as a combination
	- cards against humanity feel..
	- Everybo 100 hp.  Some weapons share the same ammo between eachother.  , you bid on ammo with your hp.
	- Mode where peoples Trusted votedy gets a random weapon at start,s are not shared, the person who won the vote is not shared, then the person eliminates someone.  Evidence is left behind? Eliminator weapon?
