TIP FORMULA...

Tips must be the last thing created, because we need the real odds based on the current gamestate...

var rand = between 1-100

if tip type = 1 "Odds of wolf"
	var rand2 = (between 0 and 20)
	var perc = 22 + rand2;
	
	if(perc between 0 and rand){
	
		//var randPlayer = a wolf
		//Tip = Theres a rand% chance that randPlayer is a Wolf
	
	}else{
	
		//var randPlayer = a sheep
		//Tip = Theres a rand% chance that randPlayer is a Wolf
	
	}
	
	
if tip type = 2 "Odds of Sheep"
